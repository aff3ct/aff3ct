abstract = {The continuous phase modulation (CPM) signaling scheme has gained interest in recent years because of its attractive spectral properties. Data symbol pulse shaping has previously been studied with regard to spectra, for binary data and modulation index 0.5. In this paper these results have been extended to the<tex>M</tex>-ary case, where the pulse shaping is over a one symbol interval, the so-called full response systems. Results are given for modulation indexes of practical interest, concerning both performance and spectrum. Comparisons are made with minimum shift keying (MSK) and systems have been found which are significantly better in<tex>E_{b}/N_{0}</tex>for a large signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) without expanded bandwidth. Schemes with the same bit error probability as MSK but with considerably smaller bandwidth have also been found. Significant improvement in both power and bandwidth are obtained by increasing the number of levels<tex>M</tex>from 2 to 4.},

abstract = {An analysis of constant envelope digital partial response continuous Phase modulation (CPM) systems is reported. Coherent detection is assumed and the channel is Gaussian. The receiver observes the received signal over more than one symbol interval to make use of the correlative properties of the transmitted signal. The Systems are<tex>M</tex>-ary, and baseband pulse shaping over several symbol intervals is considered. An optimum receiver based on the Viterbi algorithm is presented. Constant envelope digital modulation schemes with excellent spectral tail properties are given. The spectra have extremely low sidelobes. It is concluded that partial response CPM systems have spectrum compaction properties. Furthermore, at equal or even smaller bandwidth than minimum shift keying (MSK), a considerable gain in transmitter power can be obtained. This gain increases with<tex>M</tex>. Receiver and transmitter configurations are presented.},
