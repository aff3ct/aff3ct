  abstract = {A method is proposed, called channel polarization, to construct code sequences that achieve the symmetric capacity I(W) of any given binary-input discrete memoryless channel (B-DMC) W. The symmetric capacity is the highest rate achievable subject to using the input letters of the channel with equal probability. Channel polarization refers to the fact that it is possible to synthesize, out of N independent copies of a given B-DMC W, a second set of N binary-input channels {WN(i)1 les i les N} such that, as N becomes large, the fraction of indices i for which I(WN(i)) is near 1 approaches I(W) and the fraction for which I(WN(i)) is near 0 approaches 1-I(W). The polarized channels {WN(i)} are well-conditioned for channel coding: one need only send data at rate 1 through those with capacity near 1 and at rate 0 through the remaining. Codes constructed on the basis of this idea are called polar codes. The paper proves that, given any B-DMC W with I(W) $>$ 0 and any target rate R$<$ I(W) there exists a sequence of polar codes {Cfrn;nges1} such that Cfrn has block-length N=2n , rate ges R, and probability of block error under successive cancellation decoding bounded as Pe(N,R) les O(N-1/4) independently of the code rate. This performance is achievable by encoders and decoders with complexity O(N logN) for each.},

  abstract = {The state-of-the-art soft-output decoder for polar codes is a message-passing algorithm based on belief propagation, which performs well at the cost of high processing and storage requirements. In this paper, we propose a low-complexity alternative for soft-output decoding of polar codes that offers better performance but with significantly reduced processing and storage requirements. In particular we show that the complexity of the proposed decoder is only 4\% of the total complexity of the belief propagation decoder for a rate one-half polar code of dimension 4096 in the dicode channel, while achieving comparable error-rate performance. Furthermore, we show that the proposed decoder requires about 39\% of the memory required by the belief propagation decoder for a block length of 32768.},

  abstract  = {We describe a successive-cancellation list decoder for polar codes, which is a generalization of the classic successive-cancellation decoder of Arikan. In the proposed list decoder, up to L decoding paths are considered concurrently at each decoding stage. Simulation results show that the resulting performance is very close to that of a maximum-likelihood decoder, even for moderate values of L. Thus it appears that the proposed list decoder bridges the gap between successive-cancellation and maximum-likelihood decoding of polar codes. The specific list-decoding algorithm that achieves this performance doubles the number of decoding paths at each decoding step, and then uses a pruning procedure to discard all but the L {\textquotedblleft}best{\textquotedblright} paths. In order to implement this algorithm, we introduce a natural pruning criterion that can be easily evaluated. Nevertheless, straightforward implementation still requires O(L $\cdot$ n\textsuperscript{2}) time, which is in stark contrast with the O(n log n) complexity of the original successive-cancellation decoder. We utilize the structure of polar codes to overcome this problem. Specifically, we devise an efficient, numerically stable, implementation taking only O(L $\cdot$ n log n) time and O(L $\cdot$ n) space.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an optimized software implementation of a Successive Cancellation (SC) decoder for polar codes. Despite the strong data dependencies in SC decoding, a highly parallel software polar decoder is devised for x86 processor target. A high level of performance is achieved by exploiting the parallelism inherent in today's processor architectures (SIMD, multicore, etc.). Some optimizations that were originally thought for hardware implementation (memory reduction techniques and algorithmic simplifications) were also applied to enhance the throughput of the software implementation. Finally, some low level optimizations such as explicit assembly description or data packing are used to improve the throughput even more. The resulting decoder description is implemented on different x86 processor targets. An analysis of the decoder in terms of latency and throughput is proposed. The influence of several parameters on the throughput and the latency is investigated: the selected target, the code rate, the code length, the SIMD mode (SSE/AVX), the multithreading mode, etc. The energy per decoded bit is also estimated. The proposed software decoder compares favorably with state of the art software polar decoders. Extensive experimentations demonstrate that the proposed software polar decoder exceeds 1 Gb/s for code lengths N $\leq$ 2\textsuperscript{17} on a single core and reaches multi-Gb/s throughputs when using four cores in parallel in AVX mode.},

As processors are becoming increasingly powerful and energy efficient, there is now a strong desire to perform this processing in software to reduce production costs and time to market. The recently introduced family of Successive Cancellation decoders for Polar codes has been shown in several research works to efficiently leverage the ubiquitous SIMD units in modern CPUs, while offering strong potentials for a wide range of optimizations. The P-EDGE environment introduced in this paper, combines a specialized skeleton generator and a building blocks library routines to provide a generic, extensible Polar code exploration workbench. It enables ECC code designers to easily experiments with combinations of existing and new optimizations, while delivering performance close to state-of-art decoders.},
