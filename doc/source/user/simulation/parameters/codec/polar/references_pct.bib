  abstract  = {CRC (cyclic redundancy check) concatenated polar codes are superior to the turbo codes under the successive cancellation list (SCL) or successive cancellation stack (SCS) decoding algorithms. But the code length of polar codes is limited to the power of two. In this paper, a family of rate-compatible punctured polar (RCPP) codes is proposed to satisfy the construction with arbitrary code length. We propose a simple quasi-uniform puncturing algorithm to generate the puncturing table. And we prove that this method has better row-weight property than that of the random puncturing. Simulation results under the binary input additive white Gaussian noise channels (BI-AWGNs) show that these RCPP codes outperform the performance of turbo codes in WCDMA (Wideband Code Division Multiple Access) or LTE (Long Term Evolution) wireless communication systems in the large range of code lengths. Especially, the RCPP code with CRC-aided SCL/SCS algorithm can provide over 0.7dB performance gain at the block error rate (BLER) of 10\textsuperscript{-4} with short code length M = 512 and code rate R = 0.5.},

  abstract = {A novel kind of punctured polar codes is proposed in this paper. The codes are constructed by certain constraints on both puncturing patterns and frozen sets such that the values of the punctured bits are known to the decoder. As a result, the initialized log-likelihood ratios of the punctured bits can be set to infinity (or minus infinity), which guarantees a better decoding performance. Furthermore, explicit puncturing patterns are designed for arbitrary code lengths. The simulation results show that the proposed codes outperform the conventional punctured polar codes.},

  abstract = {An optimization algorithm for finding a shortening pattern and a set of frozen symbols for polar codes is proposed. The structure of polar codes is exploited to eliminate many equivalent shortening patterns, thus reducing the search space. A reduced-complexity suboptimal algorithm is proposed for finding shortening patterns for long polar codes. Shortened codes obtained with the proposed method are shown to outperform low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes.},
