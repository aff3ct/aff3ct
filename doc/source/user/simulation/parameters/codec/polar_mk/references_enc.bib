  abstract = {Polar codes are shown to be instances of both generalized concatenated codes and multilevel codes. It is shown that the performance of a polar code can be improved by representing it as a multilevel code and applying the multistage decoding algorithm with maximum likelihood decoding of outer codes. Additional performance improvement is obtained by replacing polar outer codes with other ones with better error correction performance. In some cases this also results in complexity reduction. It is shown that Gaussian approximation for density evolution enables one to accurately predict the performance of polar codes and concatenated codes based on them.},
